# Changelog

All notable changes to the FFmpeg Export Tool are documented in this file.

## [2025-10-25] ‚Äî Status Update and Logging Improvements

### üîÑ Status Changes
- Dual Pane Mode (#21) and Waveform Visualization (#23) have been removed from the main UI. Both features remain implemented at the module level with tests and can be re-enabled in a future release. Decision was based on user feedback (discoverability, layout overflow) and startup performance considerations.

### üìù Logging Improvements
- Consolidated logging into a single session log file per run. All exports (successes and failures) append to this log, and logs are always written on failure.
- Improved FFmpeg invocation flags to reduce noise where applicable.
