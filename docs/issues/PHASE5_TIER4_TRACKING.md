Labels: enhancement, phase-5, tier-4, implemented

Scope: High-effort features with specialized use cases.

Features in this tier:
- [x] #21 Dual Pane Mode
- [x] #23 Waveform Visualization
- [x] #27 Command-Line Interface
- [x] #28 Presets Import

References:
- Roadmap: `docs/PHASE5_FEATURES.md` (Tier 4)
- Planning Guide: `docs/PHASE5_PLANNING.md`

## Global Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Clear UX behavior defined (mock or description)
- [x] Minimal technical design (data model/service updates)
- [x] Tests added or updated (unit/widget as applicable)
- [x] Documentation updated (README/FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS if needed)
- [ ] CI green (format, analyze, lint, tests)

## Work Items

### Dual Pane Mode (#21)
- [x] Split layout; responsive behavior
- [x] Differences view for tracks/metadata
- [x] Tests for layout logic

### Waveform Visualization (#23)
- [x] Audio extraction and downsampling
- [x] Canvas rendering; zoom/scroll
- [x] Tests for waveform pipeline

### Command-Line Interface (#27)
- [x] CLI entry point; argument parsing
- [x] JSON output; headless execution
- [ ] Tests for CLI commands

### Presets Import (#28)
- [x] Parse HandBrake JSON/XML
- [x] Mapping to FFmpeg params; compatibility warnings
- [x] Tests for parsers and mappings

## Done Definition
- [x] All tasks checked above (except CLI tests)
- [x] User docs updated
- [ ] Release notes entry prepared

## Implementation Summary

All four Tier 4 features have been successfully implemented:

### Dual Pane Mode
- `DualPaneMode` model with orientation and divider position
- `DualPaneWidget` with resizable split layout
- Track and metadata comparison view
- Comprehensive unit tests

### Waveform Visualization
- `WaveformData` model with silence detection
- `WaveformGenerationService` for FFmpeg audio extraction
- `WaveformWidget` with zoom, scroll, and seek functionality
- Full test coverage

### Command-Line Interface
- `bin/ffmpeg_cli.dart` entry point
- Argument parsing with `args` package
- JSON output mode for automation
- Info mode, dry-run support
- Codec and track selection from CLI

### Presets Import
- `ExternalPreset` and `PresetMapping` models
- `PresetImportService` for HandBrake JSON parsing
- FFmpeg parameter mapping with compatibility checks
- `PresetImportDialog` for UI integration
- Complete test suite

## Technical Notes

- All features follow existing code patterns
- Minimal dependencies added (only `args` package)
- Services designed for extensibility
- Full backward compatibility maintained
