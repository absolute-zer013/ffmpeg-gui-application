## Recently Implemented (Post-Phase 4) ðŸ†•

These features were implemented during Phase 5 planning but are not yet reflected in the main ENHANCEMENTS.md:

- âœ… **Comprehensive Export Logging** - Per-file logs with stdout/stderr, timing, and detailed encoding info
- âœ… **Auto-Fix Codec Compatibility** - Automatic transcoding of incompatible codecs when container format selected; auto-drop unsupported subtitles
- âœ… **Dynamic Codec Filtering** - When auto-fix enabled and MP4/WebM format selected, hide incompatible codecs from UI
- âœ… **Codec Preset System for All Codecs** - Quick preset chips (Speed/Balanced/Quality) for H.264, H.265, VP9 (in addition to AV1)
- âœ… **CRF Adjustment** - Manual CRF field for all video codecs
- âœ… **Preset Switching** - Smooth codec switching with automatic reset of preset values to avoid conflicts
- âœ… **Export Summary with Encoding Details** - Display video/audio codec selections, CRF, presets, bitrates in export summary dialog
- âœ… **Cancellation Handling** - Proper exit code mapping for cancellation (shows user-friendly message instead of error)

## Acceptance criteria (general)
For each item above:
- Clear UX behavior defined (mock or description)
- Minimal technical design (data model/service updates)
- Tests added or updated (unit/widget as applicable)
- Documentation updated (README/FEATURES/ENHANCEMENTS if needed)
- CI green (format, analyze, lint, tests)

## Planning notes
- Consider sub-issues per feature for parallel work and clearer review scope.
- Apply labels: `enhancement`, `phase-5`, `backlog`.
- Optional milestone: "Phase 5".
- Keep scope tight; defer risky extras to follow-ups.
