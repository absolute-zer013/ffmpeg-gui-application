   - Mitigation: Users can use external players if needed

2. **Export Queue - Integration**
   - Queue panel widget is complete but not integrated into main export flow
   - Service and model are ready for integration
   - To add: Modify export logic to use queue service
   - Mitigation: Can be integrated in future update

3. **Desktop Notifications - Platform Support**
   - Windows only (uses PowerShell and Toast API)
   - Other platforms fall back to in-app notifications
   - To add: macOS and Linux notification support
   - Mitigation: In-app notifications work on all platforms

4. **Queue Persistence**
   - Queue metadata persists, but file data does not
   - Files need to be re-added after app restart
   - To add: Full file state persistence
   - Mitigation: Users can save/load configurations

2. JSON serialization for data persistence
3. Comprehensive error handling
4. Input validation and sanitization
5. Graceful degradation (e.g., notifications on non-Windows)
